# Website SEO Orchestrator - Planning Document

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements
- [ ] Automated end-to-end workflow from website export to import
- [ ] Integration with existing content generation and website enricher modules
- [ ] Support for managing multiple websites with different configurations
- [ ] YAML-based configuration system with environment variable support
- [ ] Detailed logging and error handling
- [ ] Dry-run capability for testing without making changes

### Technical Constraints
- [ ] Must work with Python 3.11+
- [ ] Must integrate with Node.js 18+ (for the website enricher module)
- [ ] Must support Hostinger as the primary hosting provider
- [ ] Must maintain backward compatibility with existing content generation modules

## Component Analysis

### Affected Components
- **Exporter Module**
  - Changes needed: Create a reliable website export mechanism for Hostinger
  - Dependencies: Hostinger API/credentials, workspace directory structure
  
- **Content Generator Wrapper**
  - Changes needed: Properly interface with existing content generation module
  - Dependencies: Content generation module, topics data format
  
- **Enricher Module**
  - Changes needed: Integration with Node.js-based website enricher
  - Dependencies: Node.js, enricher configuration, exported website, generated content
  
- **Importer Module**
  - Changes needed: Implement reliable upload mechanism to Hostinger
  - Dependencies: Hostinger API/credentials, enriched website structure
  
- **Orchestration Layer**
  - Changes needed: Coordinate all modules with proper error handling and logging
  - Dependencies: Configuration system, workspace structure

## Design Decisions

### Architecture
- [ ] Modular architecture with well-defined interfaces between components
- [ ] Configuration-driven approach using YAML files for global and website-specific settings
- [ ] Workspace-based file organization for each website
- [ ] Environment variable support for sensitive credentials
- [ ] Standardized logging across all modules

### UI/UX
- [ ] Command-line interface with intuitive argument structure
- [ ] Clear, color-coded console output for status and errors
- [ ] Detailed logging for debugging and audit purposes
- [ ] Progress indicators for long-running operations

### Algorithms
- [ ] Efficient file handling for website export/import
- [ ] Parallel processing for content generation when appropriate
- [ ] Proper error recovery and state management

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Framework and Configuration
- [ ] Set up project structure and dependencies
- [ ] Implement configuration loading system with environment variable support
- [ ] Create workspace management functionality
- [ ] Implement logging system

### Phase 2: Core Module Integration
- [ ] Develop exporter module for Hostinger
- [ ] Create wrapper for existing content generation module
- [ ] Implement enricher module integration
- [ ] Develop importer module for Hostinger

### Phase 3: Orchestration and Error Handling
- [ ] Implement main orchestration logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
- [ ] Create dry-run capability
- [ ] Implement progress reporting

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Create test harness for each module
- [ ] Perform integration testing
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Refine error handling and user feedback

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Configuration loading and validation
- [ ] Workspace management
- [ ] Individual module functionality with mocked dependencies

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end workflow with test website
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Dry-run mode operation
- [ ] Configuration variations

### Manual Tests
- [ ] Real-world testing with actual websites
- [ ] Performance testing with various website sizes
- [ ] Error injection and recovery testing

## Documentation Plan
- [ ] Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- [ ] Configuration reference guide
- [ ] Website configuration examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Developer documentation for extending the system

## Creative Phases Required
- [ ] üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design: Module interaction and workspace structure
- [ ] ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Design: Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] üé® UI/UX Design: Command-line interface and output formatting

## Timeline Estimate
- Framework and Configuration: 1 week
- Core Module Integration: 2 weeks
- Orchestration and Error Handling: 1 week
- Testing and Refinement: 1 week
- Documentation: Ongoing throughout development

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Integration issues with existing modules
  - **Mitigation**: Create clear interface definitions and thorough testing

- **Risk**: Hostinger API changes or limitations
  - **Mitigation**: Implement graceful error handling and version detection

- **Risk**: Performance issues with large websites
  - **Mitigation**: Implement progress tracking and optimization for file operations
