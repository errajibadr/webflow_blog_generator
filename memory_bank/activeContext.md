- architecture.md: Detailed system architecture with component responsibilities and data flow
- implementation_plan.md: Phased implementation approach with timeline and milestones

## Creative Phases Completed
- üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design: Module interaction patterns using Command Pattern with Strategy
- ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Design: Error handling using hierarchical exceptions with decorator pattern
- üé® UI/UX Design: Command-line interface with multiple output modes

## Active Components
- Main orchestrator script (main.py)
- Configuration system (config.yaml, website_configs/*.yaml)
- Workspace structure for website content

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of base interfaces and abstract classes
- Create configuration and workspace management components
- Implement error handling framework
- Develop command-line interface parser and output manager
- Start implementing individual module strategies
