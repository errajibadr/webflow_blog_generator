# Progress

## VAN Mode
- âœ… Platform Detection: macOS detected, path separator confirmed, command adaptations noted
- âœ… File Verification: Memory Bank structure created
- âœ… Complexity Determination: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)
- âœ… Mode Transition: VAN â†’ PLAN completed

## PLAN Mode
- âœ… Requirements Analysis: Core requirements and technical constraints identified
- âœ… Component Analysis: Affected components and dependencies documented
- âœ… Design Decisions: Architecture, UI/UX, and algorithm designs outlined
- âœ… Implementation Strategy: Phased approach with clear milestones defined
- âœ… Testing Strategy: Unit, integration, and manual testing plans created
- âœ… Documentation Plan: Comprehensive documentation requirements identified
- âœ… Creative Phases: Architecture, algorithm, and UI/UX design phases flagged
- âœ… Risk Assessment: Key risks identified with monitoring and mitigation strategies

## CREATIVE Mode
- âœ… Architecture Design: Command Pattern with Strategy approach selected for module interactions
- âœ… Algorithm Design: Hybrid approach with hierarchical exceptions and decorators for error handling
- âœ… UI/UX Design: Hybrid CLI with multiple output modes designed
- âœ… Interface Specifications: Detailed interface definitions created for all components
- âœ… Error Handling Patterns: Comprehensive error handling strategy developed
- âœ… Mode Transition: CREATIVE â†’ IMPLEMENT ready

## Current Status
- ðŸš€ VAN mode completed successfully
- âœ… PLAN mode completed successfully
- âœ… CREATIVE mode completed successfully
- ðŸ”„ IMPLEMENT mode initialization pending

## Implementation Metrics
- Project Initialization: 100%
- Planning Phase: 100%
- Creative Phase: 100%
- Development Phase: 0%
- Testing & Quality Assurance: 0%

## Notes
- Creative phase has delivered detailed design decisions for architecture, algorithms, and UI/UX
- The implementation should follow the Command Pattern with Strategy for module interactions
- Error handling should use hierarchical exceptions with decorator-based retry and recovery
- CLI should support multiple output modes (normal, verbose, quiet, JSON)
- Implementation should follow the 5-week timeline in implementation_plan.md
