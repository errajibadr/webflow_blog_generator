# Import Logic Improvement - Planning Document

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements
- [ ] Design a secure mechanism for storing FTP credentials
- [ ] Support easy addition of new websites in workspaces
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing website configurations
- [ ] Ensure credentials are accessible for import/export operations
- [ ] Prevent hardcoding credentials in configuration files

### Technical Constraints
- [ ] Must work with the existing Python codebase
- [ ] Should follow security best practices for credential storage
- [ ] Must be compatible with macOS/Linux/Windows environments
- [ ] Should not significantly increase complexity for users

## Component Analysis

### Affected Components
- **Configuration Management**
  - Changes needed: Add support for external credential storage
  - Dependencies: dotenv, yaml modules
  
- **Exporter Module (modules/exporter.py)**
  - Changes needed: Update FTP credential retrieval
  - Dependencies: Configuration management changes
  
- **Importer Module (modules/importer.py)**
  - Changes needed: Update FTP credential retrieval
  - Dependencies: Configuration management changes
  
- **CLI Interface (main.py)**
  - Changes needed: Add commands for credential management
  - Dependencies: New credential management module

## Design Decisions

### Architecture
- [ ] Use a dedicated credentials file (.env) for sensitive information
- [ ] Implement a credential manager module to handle secure operations
- [ ] Store references to credentials in website configs, not the actual values
- [ ] Use environment variables as the secure transport mechanism

### UI/UX
- [ ] Create simple CLI commands for managing credentials
- [ ] Design clear error messages for credential issues
- [ ] Implement validation for credential inputs

### Security
- [ ] Ensure credentials file is in .gitignore
- [ ] Implement basic encryption for stored credentials
- [ ] Add permission checks for credentials file
- [ ] Include documentation on secure credential handling

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Credential Management
1. [ ] Create a dedicated credentials management module
2. [ ] Implement secure storage of credentials in .env file
3. [ ] Update configuration loading to reference external credentials
4. [ ] Add validation for credential presence and format

### Phase 2: Integration with Existing Modules
1. [ ] Update exporter.py to use new credential management
2. [ ] Update importer.py to use new credential management
3. [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing configs
4. [ ] Add migration support for existing hardcoded credentials

### Phase 3: User Interface and Documentation
1. [ ] Add CLI commands for credential management
2. [ ] Create user documentation for credential setup
3. [ ] Update example configurations to use new credential approach
4. [ ] Add security advisories to documentation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test credential storage and retrieval
- [ ] Test configuration loading with external credentials
- [ ] Test validation of credential formats

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test full export/import cycle with new credential system
- [ ] Test adding new website with credentials
- [ ] Test backward compatibility with existing config format

## Documentation Plan
- [ ] Update README with credential management instructions
- [ ] Add security best practices section
- [ ] Update website configuration examples
- [ ] Document CLI commands for credential management

## Creative Phases Required
- [ ] üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design for credential management system
- [ ] ‚öôÔ∏è Security algorithm design for credential storage

## Current Status
- Phase: Planning
- Status: In Progress
- Blockers: None
