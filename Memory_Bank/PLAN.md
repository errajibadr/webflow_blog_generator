                  │ (.env.encrypted)  │   │               │   │  (External)   │
                  │                   │   │               │   │               │
                  └───────────────────┘   └───────────────┘   └───────────────┘
```

The system will use:
- A pluggable backend system for credential storage
- Multiple backend options for different deployment scenarios
- Extended environment variable references in configuration files
- Secure memory handling for sensitive data
- A comprehensive CLI interface for credential management

### Backend Options

1. **File Backend (Default)**
   - Encrypted file storage using Fernet encryption
   - Suitable for development and simple deployments
   - Works well on single-server installations

2. **Environment Backend**
   - Uses environment variables directly
   - Ideal for containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes)
   - No persistent storage needed, works with container orchestration

3. **External API Backend (Future)**
   - Integration with HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.
   - Supports advanced features like rotation and auditing
   - Ideal for production and multi-user environments

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Credential Management (1-2 days)
- Create credential manager module with backend abstraction
- Implement File Backend (default) and Environment Backend
- Add backend selection mechanism
- Build credential API (store, get, delete, list)

#### Phase 2: Configuration Integration (2-3 days)
- Extend config loading to support credential references
- Update importer and exporter modules
- Add migration utility for existing configurations
- Ensure backward compatibility

#### Phase 3: User Interface and Documentation (1-2 days)
- Add CLI commands for credential management
- Implement interactive mode for sensitive input
- Create clear error messages and help text
- Update documentation with security best practices
- Add containerization examples and guides

### Security Considerations

1. Credentials will be stored securely based on the selected backend
2. Encryption will be used for sensitive data at rest
3. Credentials will never be exposed in logs or configuration files
4. Secure memory handling will prevent credential leakage
5. Backend-specific security best practices will be documented

### CLI Interface

The following commands will be implemented:

```
python main.py --credential add --website WEBSITE_NAME --type TYPE [--value VALUE | --interactive]
python main.py --credential remove --website WEBSITE_NAME [--type TYPE] [--force]
python main.py --credential list [--website WEBSITE_NAME] [--show-values]
python main.py --credential test --website WEBSITE_NAME [--host HOST]
python main.py --credential-backend [file|env|vault] [--backend-config KEY=VALUE]
```

### Configuration Changes

Current format:
```yaml
hostinger:
  host: ftp.sample-website.com
  username: ${HOSTINGER_FTP_USERNAME}  
  password: ${HOSTINGER_FTP_PASSWORD}
```

New format:
```yaml
hostinger:
  host: ftp.sample-website.com
  username: ${cred:SAMPLE_WEBSITE_FTP_USERNAME}  
  password: ${cred:SAMPLE_WEBSITE_FTP_PASSWORD}
```

Backend configuration:
```yaml
credential_manager:
  backend: "file"  # Options: file, env, vault
  backend_config:
    file:
      path: ".env.encrypted"
    env:
      prefix: "CRED_"
    vault:
      url: "https://vault.example.com"
      token_env: "VAULT_TOKEN"
```

### Containerization Support

The updated design specifically supports containerization:

1. **Environment Backend**
   - Uses container environment variables directly
   - No file persistence issues between container restarts
   - Works with Docker Compose and Kubernetes secrets

2. **External API Backend**
   - Integrates with container orchestration secret services
   - No secrets stored in container images
   - Centralized credential management for multiple containers

3. **Deployment Examples**
   - Docker Compose examples with environment variables
   - Kubernetes manifest examples with secrets
   - Docker volume configuration for file backend (if needed)

### Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each backend implementation
2. Integration tests for configuration loading with credentials
3. End-to-end tests for the full export/import cycle
4. Security tests for credential handling and encryption
5. Container deployment tests

### Documentation Plan

1. Update README with credential management instructions
2. Create security best practices guide
3. Add example configurations using credential references
4. Document CLI commands for credential management
5. Add containerization guide with examples

### Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of core Credential Manager module with backend abstraction
2. Implement File Backend and Environment Backend
3. Implement configuration loading extensions
4. Update import/export modules to use credential manager
5. Create containerization examples

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Broken backward compatibility | Medium | High | Thorough testing, fallback mechanism |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | Security review, best practices |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Caching, optimization |
| User confusion | Medium | Medium | Clear documentation, examples |
| Container integration issues | Medium | High | Detailed containerization examples |

This plan is now ready for implementation, with a clear path forward to improve the import logic and credential management of the Website Blog Generator Orchestrator while ensuring compatibility with containerized deployments. 

# FTP Importer Refactoring and Optimization Plan

## Project: Website Blog Generator Orchestrator
## Task: Refactor and Optimize FTP Importer

### Task Overview

The current codebase has duplicate FTP import functionality in the `modules/importer.py` file:
1. `import_website()` - A basic implementation with limited error handling and logging
2. `_import_via_ftp()` - A more robust implementation with better logging and path handling

This plan outlines the steps to refactor these functions into a single, optimized implementation that consolidates the best features of both while improving performance through concurrency.

### Complexity Assessment

This task is classified as **Level 3 (Intermediate)** complexity because it requires:
- Significant refactoring of existing code
- Implementation of concurrent file transfers
- Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization techniques

### Requirements Analysis

#### Core Requirements

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - Consolidate duplicate FTP import functionality into a unified implementation
   - Preserve all existing features from both current implementations
   - Support importing from multiple source directories
   - Support preserving directory structure
   - Support purging remote directories before import
   - Support timestamp-based file change detection
   - Add support for credential retrieval from both config and credential manager
   - Maintain comprehensive logging

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Implement concurrent file uploads to improve speed
   - Add file batching to reduce connection overhead
   - Implement retry logic for failed transfers
   - Add optional checksum-based change detection for more reliable comparisons

3. **Error Handling Requirements**
   - Implement robust error handling for all FTP operations
   - Add recovery mechanisms for temporary failures
   - Provide detailed logging of all operations and errors
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries

#### Technical Constraints

- Continue using the ftputil library as the primary FTP client
- Maintain compatibility with existing configuration structure
- Ensure binary mode transfers for all file types
- Support secure credential management through the credential manager

### Implementation Strategy

Our implementation strategy follows a phased approach:

#### Phase 1: Function Consolidation

1. Create a new class-based implementation in a dedicated file `modules/ftp_importer.py`
2. Extract and refactor connection logic from both existing functions
3. Implement directory management functions based on the more robust approach in `_import_via_ftp`
4. Create optimized file upload methods with retry capabilities
5. Implement a unified website import method that handles all use cases
6. Update the main `importer.py` to use the new implementation

#### Phase 2: Performance Optimization

1. Add concurrent file uploads using ThreadPoolExecutor
2. Implement file batching for directories with many small files
3. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Implement progress reporting for long-running operations

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. Add optional checksum-based file comparison for reliable change detection
2. Implement chunked uploads for large files
3. Add bandwidth throttling options
4. Implement connection pooling

4. After thorough testing, remove the deprecated functions

### Conclusion

This refactoring will significantly improve the performance, reliability, and maintainability of the website import functionality. By consolidating duplicate code and implementing concurrent uploads, we expect to see substantial speed improvements, especially for websites with many files. The enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms will also improve reliability for imports over unstable connections.
