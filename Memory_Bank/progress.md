## Implementation Status

### Existing System
The system is currently operational with a complete pipeline from website export to import:

1. **Export**: âœ… Functioning via FTP with incremental downloads
2. **Content Generation**: âœ… Working with API integration
3. **Enrichment**: âœ… Successfully integrating content with Node.js tool
4. **Import**: âœ… Uploading to Hostinger with change detection

### Credential Management Enhancement
Implementation progress for the new credential management system:

1. **Core Credential Manager**: ðŸ”„ Planning completed, implementation pending
   - [ ] Create module structure
   - [ ] Implement encryption/decryption
   - [ ] Add secure storage
   - [ ] Build API functions

2. **Configuration Integration**: ðŸ”„ Planning completed, implementation pending
   - [ ] Extend configuration loading
   - [ ] Update import/export modules
   - [ ] Add migration utilities
   - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility

3. **User Interface**: ðŸ”„ Planning completed, implementation pending
   - [ ] Add CLI commands
   - [ ] Implement interactive mode
   - [ ] Create error messages
   - [ ] Update documentation

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of core credential manager module
2. Create unit tests for encryption and storage functions
3. Implement configuration loading extensions
4. Update import/export modules to use credential manager
5. Add CLI interface for credential management
6. Create documentation and examples

## FTP Importer Refactoring Progress - Phase 1 Complete

### Completed Work

Phase 1 of the FTP Importer refactoring has been successfully completed. The following tasks were accomplished:

1. Created a new `modules/ftp_importer.py` file with a modular `FTPImporter` class
2. Implemented robust connection logic with credential management support
3. Added comprehensive directory management methods
4. Implemented file upload logic with retry capabilities
5. Created a unified import method that combines features from both previous implementations
6. Updated the main `importer.py` file to use the new implementation

The new implementation offers several improvements over the previous code:

- **Better organization**: Clear class structure with well-defined responsibilities
- **Improved error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- **Retry logic**: Built-in retry mechanism for failed uploads with exponential backoff
- **Cleaner API**: Simplified interface for website importing
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed statistics and progress reporting
- **Foundation for concurrency**: Structure in place for Phase 2 concurrent uploads

### Next Steps

The focus will now shift to Phase 2 of the refactoring plan:

1. Implement concurrent file uploads using ThreadPoolExecutor 
2. Add file batching for directories with many small files
3. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for network issues
4. Add progress reporting for long-running operations

Phase 2 will significantly improve the performance of website imports, especially for sites with many files.

### Implementation Details

The new `FTPImporter` class uses the following structure:

```python
class FTPImporter:
    def __init__(self, config, max_workers=4, chunk_size=8192)
    def connect(self, website_name)
    def import_website(self, website_name, source_dirs=None, purge_remote=False)
    def _process_directory(self, ftp_host, source_dir, remote_base_dir, preserve_parent)
    def _process_files(self, ftp_host, local_dir, remote_dir, filenames)
    def _upload_file(self, ftp_host, local_file, remote_file, retries=3, backoff_factor=2)
    def _should_upload_file(self, ftp_host, local_file, remote_file)
    def _ensure_remote_dir(self, ftp_host, remote_dir)
    def _purge_remote_dir(self, ftp_host, remote_dir)
```

The new implementation maintains backward compatibility through wrapper functions in `importer.py` that delegate to the new `FTPImporter` class.

### Integration Status

The refactored code has been integrated into the main codebase. The following components use the new implementation:

- `modules/importer.py` - Updated to use the new `FTPImporter` class
- Both `import_website()` and `_import_via_ftp()` functions now delegate to the new implementation

Original functions have been kept for backward compatibility but have been simplified to use the new implementation.
