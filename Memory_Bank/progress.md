## Implementation Status

### Existing System
The system is currently operational with a complete pipeline from website export to import:

1. **Export**: âœ… Functioning via FTP with incremental downloads
2. **Content Generation**: âœ… Working with API integration
3. **Enrichment**: âœ… Successfully integrating content with Node.js tool
4. **Import**: âœ… Uploading to Hostinger with change detection

### Credential Management Enhancement
Implementation progress for the new credential management system:

1. **Core Credential Manager**: ðŸ”„ Planning completed, implementation pending
   - [ ] Create module structure
   - [ ] Implement encryption/decryption
   - [ ] Add secure storage
   - [ ] Build API functions

2. **Configuration Integration**: ðŸ”„ Planning completed, implementation pending
   - [ ] Extend configuration loading
   - [ ] Update import/export modules
   - [ ] Add migration utilities
   - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility

3. **User Interface**: ðŸ”„ Planning completed, implementation pending
   - [ ] Add CLI commands
   - [ ] Implement interactive mode
   - [ ] Create error messages
   - [ ] Update documentation

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of core credential manager module
2. Create unit tests for encryption and storage functions
3. Implement configuration loading extensions
4. Update import/export modules to use credential manager
5. Add CLI interface for credential management
6. Create documentation and examples
